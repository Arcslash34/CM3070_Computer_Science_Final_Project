## 🏗 Architecture

**Data Tier**

- Supabase tables: `profiles`, `quiz_results`, `user_disaster_badges`
- Local: AsyncStorage (preferences, flags)
- Static JSON: quizzes, checklists, translations
- External APIs: NEA endpoints for environment data
- Scripted snapshot: `scripts/snapshot.js` → `assets/env_snapshot.json`

**Logic Tier**

- Containers: orchestrate data + actions (e.g., `QuizGameContainer`, `InteractiveMapModalContainer`, `SettingsContainer`, `CertificatesContainer`)
- Services: `supabase.js`, env fetchers, badge/quiz utilities
- Caching: in-memory TTL + de-dup for network requests

**UI / Presentation Tier**

- Screens: Quizzes, Quiz Game, Quiz Set, History, Result Summary
- Resource Hub & Article, Home (dashboard), Settings, Certificates, Siren
- Components: cards, modals, progress bars, map views, lists
